**Introduction**

This project involves gathering and processing extensive datasets from various sources within the life expectancy dataset, including adult mortality, infant deaths, life expectancy and various diseases data. Utilizing advanced Python APIs such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, the project focuses on implementing sophisticated data science techniques to extract valuable insights and patterns. Key components of the project include data cleaning, normalization, and integration to ensure consistency and accuracy across diverse data sources. Exploratory data analysis techniques are employed to uncover trends, correlations, and anomalieswithin the datasets, providing a deeper understanding of crime patterns, resource allocation, and community dynamics.Machine learning models are developed and trained on the processed data to predict life expectancy of a country, country wise population prediction. These models leverage advanced algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks to achieve high predictive accuracy and reliability.
